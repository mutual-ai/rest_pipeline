# Resting-State fMRI Analysis Pipeline using CONN (rest_pipeline)

This code is intended to be used in our lab only, but feel free to have a look at it and how I made use of CONN's batch functionality.

## Introduction
This MATLAB-pipeline is based on CONN (Functional Connectivity Toolbox) and is intended to merely serve me as a wrapper for CONN's batch function, which can be quite tedious some times. The basic idea is to simplify the import of data, the use of multiple atlases and within these the specification of (the to-be-analyzed) ROIs - all when using CONN's batch functionality.

## Installation
No installation is needed, but you need CONN and SPM.
